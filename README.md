Project I carried out for learning with the help of a tutorial by Fernanda Kipper about a back end challenge.

Main functionality of the application: The application aims to deposit and transfer money between users. We have 2 types of users, ordinary users and retailers, both have wallets with money and make transfers between them.

## Technologies:
* Java
* Spring Boot
* RESTful API
* JUnit
* Mockito
* Postman

## I added some features like:
